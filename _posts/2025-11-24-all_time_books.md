I love reading[^1].  I get a lot out of reading from entertainment to education.  I have lots of thoughts on why reading is important, how I've learned to be better at it, but I'd like to keep this intro short and sweet.  These books aren't ranked, and over time I hope to currate this list to continue to reflect my views.

<h2> Non-fiction</h2>

[^1] More precisely, I love listening to audio books.  I'm dyslexic, so my reading speed and comprehension is terrible.  As an example, it tooks me about 7 months to read `Pillars of the Earth'; while that novel is increadible and worth the read, you can imagine how I lean away from the format.
