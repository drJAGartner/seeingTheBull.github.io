I love reading<sup>[1]</sup>.  I get a lot out of reading from entertainment to education.  I have lots of thoughts on why reading is important, how I've learned to be better at it, but I'd like to keep this intro short and sweet.  These books aren't ranked, and over time I hope to currate this list to continue to reflect my views.  I'm keeping it to pre-2025, because if I do a good job in keeping up, my hope is that I'll have better notes on what I've read over time.  I hope to fill out short intros for by fiction and non-fiction mainstays, but I'll start by simply getting the list up.

<h2> Fiction </h2>

    <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Surely-Youre-Joking-Mr-Feynman-Audiobook/B002V5D7IE?source_code=ASSGB149080119000H&share_location=pdp">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a> - Richard Feynman is a physicist who was awarded the Nobel prize in 1965 for his contributions to the development of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).  This may not sounds like a real page turner, but physics is a small part of the book.  Feynman was eccentric, a rule breaker, and uncompromising.  He was one of the younger physicist on the Manhattan Project, where he spent his time breaking into room secure areas, creating codes to send his wife love notes, and doing ground breaking physics research.  The book is highly entertaining, and requires no real understanding of physics.  The biggest reason to love Feynman is his direct confrontation of bullshit.  He particularly questioned how people learn, and hated systems that emphasized rote memorization of fact.  As the interent, and increasingly AI makes recall a less important skill, his focus on logical reasoning and building complexity from first principles was ahead of it's time.<br/><br/>
    Without a doubt, the best quote from the book: <em>“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool."</em> I think of this as one of the guiding principles I try to live by.

    <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Audiobook/B06XTZZLZ8?source_code=ASSGB149080119000H&share_location=pdp">The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</a> - Another great scientific communicator, Carl Sagan's book is a masterclass describing why all people should have some level of scientific literacy.  For younger folks, Carl Sagan was the original Neil deGrasse Tyson; an astronomer who excelled at getting people excited about astronomy, and was so good at it he became the defacto "spokesperson for science" of his generation.  I find that the best science teachers know that motivating people to connect with the material is more than half the battle.  The people that become good scientists are mostly people who need little motivation, but the beauty of his work is that he was trying to reach the rest of the crowd.<br/><br/>
    While I enjoy a few of his books, I favor this work because it speaks directly to the consequences on daily lives. The following excerpt gives good color to the gravity he extends to the topic: <em>"Science is mor than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking.  I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time - when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, an no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgably question those in authority; when clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness."</em>  This book was published nearly 30 years ago, but the predictions have a haunting feel to them.

    <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Deep-Thinking-Audiobook/B06XWZK4CF?source_code=ASSGB149080119000H&share_location=pdp">Deep Thinking</a>.  Written by one of the greatest chess players of all time, Garry Kasparov tells the story of being the world chess champion at the time that computers ability to play chess surpassed humans.  Kasparov is a tremendous author, he makes the story engaging and relatable, despite his ability to perform being so unrelatable.  The book gives an engaging history of chess computers, specifically focusing on why it was hard, and how computers are able to think about chess in a way that is completely different than humans.<br/><br/>
    I've gifted this book to many of the data scientists I work with, as the view into an expert in their field being surpassed by computer ability is something more and more of us are going to have to live through.  Kasparov handles this with a level of grace that we can all aspire to; he saw the progress of computers abilites as inevitable and embraced the change it brought.  The popular sentiment was that the rise of computers would make chess irrelivant; it is currently more popular than it has ever been, and computer engines serve as distributed teachers making high level chess instruction accessible to people all over the world.   By way of analogy, this book can serve as what a successful transition into the future should look like.

<sup>[1]</sup> More precisely, I love listening to audio books.  I'm dyslexic, so my reading speed and comprehension is terrible.  As an example, it tooks me about 7 months to read `Pillars of the Earth'; while that novel is increadible and worth the read, you can imagine how I lean away from the format.
